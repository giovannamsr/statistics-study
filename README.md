1. Spline_MSE.R is a straightforward R script that generates graphical representations of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) calculated using splines for both training and test datasets. Also, a cross validation is performed to select the best degree of freedom.
2. KNN_MSE.R is similar to Spline_MSE. It is a script that optimizes hyperparameters to define the best k for adjusting knn.
